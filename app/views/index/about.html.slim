    I love empowering women through beauty.
    =======================================

    A clumsy makeup artist, a new wife, daughter, sister and a mother to 2
    furry babies... I laugh a lot, find amusement in the random things, and
    Instagram lot.

    I'm a lover of simplicity, effortless style, clean design, and random
    occurrences. You can often find me in false lashes, sipping on an iced
    coffee or enjoying a refreshing glass of white wine. I enjoy a good weekend
    brunch, great conversation, and even better company.  

    To know me is to love me so get to know me here.

    Oh yea, puppies are my weakness.
