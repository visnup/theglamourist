      Jane,
      
      Hi, my name is David Nghiem, Visnu's friend, even though we don't hang out much.
      
      I'm seriously wondering how much for a makeup session to glamour me up girl style, geisha like.  It's a personal fantasy of mine, which I can't indulge, but thought this would be a good one-time thing.  It will make a nice Facebook profile picture, I hope.
      
      So let me know how much this would cost?  I would need to wash it off immediately after the photo.
      
      Strictest confidence,
      David N.

      Hi Jane,
      
      I'm getting married at ruby hill golf course in pleasanton ca on sat 8/21/2010. I was wondering what your pricing is for 1 bride, 7 bridesmaids, and 2 moms. Since its potentially 10 people, would you be doing everyone's hair and make up or working with an assistant? will there be a travel fee? How much to secure a date?
      
      Thanks,
      Irene

      Hi, I'm looking for someone to do my hair / make-up for my Sonoma valley wedding on Sunday, 9/5.  It'd also be for make-up for 4 bridesmaids and hair for 1 bridesmaid.  
      
      i've had my make-up done a few times, and i must admit it's all been a bit scarring.  i wear a little make-up everyday - neutral eye shadow, liner and a cheek tint - but i never wear foundation or powder.  i'm definitely a bit nervous about having make-up caked onto my face on the day of my wedding.  even though i know it's necessary for the photos, i'd really just like to look like a more polished version of myself the day of my wedding.  i had one trial done over the weekend and while it definitely looked good in the photos, the make-up was very cakey and my fiance admitted that i looked a bit scary in person, and i don't want that the day of my wedding.  if you can help, please contact me!

      Hi!  I'm getting married at the Bently Reserve on 5/1/2010.  I was wondering what your rates are for bridal makeup and hair.  Do you do eyelash extentions and hair extentions?  Also, do you charge for travel fee?  How much is your wedding trial fee?
      
      Thanks!
      
      Alice

      I saw your ad thru knot.com.  I am getting married on Sunday, October 10, 2010.
      
      I have a person who does hair, however, since our wedding ceremony starts 11am and if she has to do all hair and make up, we will have to get start at 3am..that's too extreme, 
      
      So, I am looking for a person who does make up for all my 3 bridemaids.
      
      Please let me know your price and your availabilities. 
      Thank you. Kazu

      Hi Jane,
      
      I'm getting married in april and am looking for a make up artist.  I do my own make up well, but i beleive you do airbrush, which is beyond my skills.  I have dark spots, which I conceal a lot, and am a mixture of hispanic and black, so have a skin tone that is challenging to match with some make up brands.  I have been using mac and make up forever.   I have dry skin and eczema, to make things more interesting!  ;)  I had planned on doing my own make up to spend less, but maybe you are more affordable than I think.  Doesnt hurt to ask.
      Thanks Jane,

      Hello Jane,
      
      You were recommended on The Knot website and I checked out the review on Yelp. Based on the Yelp review- as I am similar to the reviewer in terms of make up use and preference- and your portfolio on your website, I am interested in having a trial session with you. What is your cost for such a session? How long would the session be?
      
      If your cost is within my range, I would like to have a session with you this Sunday, Aug 29th in the morning if possible as I have an engagement photo shoot in the afternoon (around 1 pm).
      
      I look forward to hearing from you. My cell number is: 415-828-7837.

The look I am going for is old school hollywood glamour, with a touch of 1930's flapper.  I currently have short hair and am hoping it grows long enough for pin curls, but I also am open to suggestions.  I think I would want fake eyelashes as well.  Anyhow, please let me know your availability, and I wanted to hopefully set up a consultation with you, taking advantage of your free offer.  Thank you so much!  I can email pictures of ideas I have as well.  Thanks again, Liz

      Hi Jane,
      
      Just curious about your charges for a wedding group of about 11 (bride, 6 bridesmaids, 2 Jr. bridesmaids, 2 flower girls -gotta love little cousins who would die if they weren't in your wedding).  I am not sure if the mother's want to be included.  
      
      The wedding is in Moraga, Ca, at Saint Mary's College on July 9, 2011 at 5:15pm.
      
      Thank you!
      Katie

    - |
      Your hair and makeup is  just as important as finding the perfect wedding dress.   Makeup and hair can set the tone for the entire day because it has the power to make a bride feel confident and beautiful.   Just like how a great photographer or a videographer  is able to capture each memory,  the right makeup artist ensures you look beautiful and flawless in each memory/image that is  captured.  Not just for today. Not just for tomorrow but as long as those memories  last.

      These past few weeks have been quite busy! I had a few weddings, booked 3 more clients for this season, booked 2 photo shoots and planning a my boyfriend's birthday party. Whew!  
      
      I wanted to share with you a little tidbit from the wedding I did this weekend.  Pictured below is the mother of the groom's before and after.  Normally she doesn't wear makeup, maybe a tad bit of concealer but pretty much nothing.  I glammed her up with some color and smoothed out her hair with an flatiron.   Look how amazing she looks, with just a little bit of makeup.
      
      Here are the unedited before and after pics...

      I just finalized a booking last night and I am so excited!  Jess Dang, who is getting married in beautiful Sonoma this coming September, was a contestant on the Food Network's show The Next Food Network Star.  She was one of the contestants in the season that Guy Fieri won.  Those who know me and kind of sort of know me, know that I LOVE food.  So meeting someone who has met all the greats on one of my favorite networks is a real treat.    
      
      Just like me, Jess has a food blog called thepetitepig.com where she shares wonderful and yet easy recipes.    It's amazing because she's a complete foodie but soooo tiny... where does all the food go?
      
      After going off in a tangent,  I wanted share with you some looks that we tested.   She wanted to be a polished version of her natural self but with definition in the eyes and a beautiful glow.  So we kept the makeup very simple but softened up  black eye shadow on her lids.  As for the hair, she wants to wear two styles one for the reception and another for the ceremony.  
      
      Check out her pics...

      A few weeks ago, I did makeup and hair a beautiful couple Alex and Alica.  Well, mainly  Alicia but she is one half of the beautiful couple.   This was probably one of the beautiful and scenic weddings I have had the pleasure of being a part of.  The photographer [JP Langland] did the most of amazing job in capturing the scenery and the beautiful, and yet silly, essence of the bride and groom. Of course, hats off to [Lily Spruce] for making this a seamless event.
      
      The venue was held  at the [Russian River Rose Company], which is the home of the groom's parents.    It was  a casual affair with bbq, lemonade, a jukebox and popcorn machine.  Being that it was casual affair, the bride wanted to look natural but with a bit of color.  She did not want to wear foundation because she wanted her freckles to shine through. For the makeup,  I primed her skin with [MAC's] strobe cream and dusted mineral powder for coverage.  Applied a bit of lip tint and a cheek tint to give her the rosy color.  For the eyes, I applied just a thin layer of liquid liner and a double coating of mascara.  For the hair, she wanted  a retro look, so we did a pin curled the bangs and in the back looped a ponytail through and pinned it up.
      
      Below are some pictures of the wedding, thanks again to [JP Langland] for sharing these wonderful pictures.  Be sure to check out his website for your event!

      When I first met Allie, i thought she was jaw-droppingly gorgeous, so it was no surprise that she needed minimal makeup.  We kept the mood very natural and changed to cat-eyes and red lips for a later look.

      I was honored when Patty, the mastermind behind [8events], asked me to be the makeup artist for her bridal party for her wedding day.  She enlisted the who's who of wedding vendors for her big day, [Jennifer Skog], [Maria Chang of PMA], [8events] and [Stillmotion], to name a few.  It was such an honor to be apart of such an elite team of wedding professionals.
      
      She shared with me clip of her video (below) and I was floored by [Stillmotion]'s work.  I was in tears!  They did a wonderful job in capturing the vintage essence that Patty had envisioned.
      
      May Patty and Eugene live happily ever after.

    - JULIE & MARCUS | BOLINAS WEDDING
    - |-
      Julie emailed me last thursday, we set up a preview session for  friday and then the wedding was to be held the following saturday! 
      
      Julie is probably the coolest and most casual bride I have ever met.  When most brides are stressing over seating charts, registries and timelines, Julie evited her 25 closest family and friends, rented a beach house, enlisted a food truck, Roli Roti, to cater the dinner and did I mention the reception involved surfing lessons?  There was no centerpieces, no seating charts nor a bridal party.  Her Carolyn Bisset-esque dress was made by her dear friend and the whole event was to be documented by her mother, a photographer.  I along with the 2 food trucks, were the only vendors the bride and groom hired for for this wedding.
      
      Bolinas is a sleepy little beach town just north of San Francisco and very reminiscent of Oahu's North Shore.   To match the beachy setting and casualness of the event,  she wanted a natural sunkissed look but accentuating her eyes. I kept the palette very bronze and peachy and heightened her eyes with liquid liner.
      
      Here is her before and after shots and pictures of the church. 
      
      (she put on the veil so quickly,  i didn't have a chance to capture her look without the veil)

    - |-
      So this coming October, I will be a Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding.  As the appointed MOH, it is within my role to coordinate the bridal shower and the bachelorette party.  I wanted to do this bride proud and take my role seriously.  I wanted play my role in a traditional way but still keep it modern.

    - "I opened my inbox this morning to find a little message from this past weekend's bride...\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Dear Jane,\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I don't know how to say it well but here it goes: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE AMAZING WORK YOU DID ON SATURDAY!  I am just now starting to recover from how much fun the wedding was.  I'm so lucky to have found you at the last second, that was the best desperate phone call I ever made!  You were amazing...\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Thank you so much Erika! You were a delight to work with and tons of fun.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I'm excited to see the images from the talented Alison Yin.  "

    - MEGAN & STAN | SAN FRANCISCO ELOPEMENT
    - |
      Megan & Stan were a  delight and an easy going couple to work with.  Not to mention, they were complete champs in roughing, the rare, SF heat wave.  Previously, Megan had sent me some makeup looks that she had liked and when I arrived at the hotel room she said they would also be doing casual shots later on.  With that information, I went to town.   For the hair, I wanted to do a simple, slightly messy, less than perfect updo so that it would be easy to take down later... too much hair spray was not an option.  For the makeup, based on the images, she wanted slightly smokey, defined eyes but soft since it was daylight and a very casual affair. 
      
      The talented [Augie Chang] was commissioned to capture their tender moments.  He was also kind enough to send the teasers, THE SAME DAY!

    - ERIKA & COLIN | A BEREKLEY AFFAIR
    - |-
      One of the questions that I get asked the most is "do you ever deal with any bridezillas"?   I have been fortunate enough to say that I have not.    This wedding was no different, Erika was probably one of my most favorite brides.  I know I say this about most of my brides but Erika truly has an infectious bubbly personality that makes you feel like old time friends.  You can't help but fall in love with her.  I can totally understand why Colin chose her to spend his happily ever after with.
      
      I must add, the old cliche is indeed true... "you are the company you keep".  Her bridesmaids were all a riot.  Each and everyone of them were so sweet, so genuine and truly beautiful girls!  One of them called me a "life-changer"... all for applying falsies on her.
      
      For her makeup she wanted to keep a very natural feel with some definition in the eyes.  I kept the makeup on neutral palette with browns, peaches and corals. Picking a makeup artist is like picking a dress.  When you know, you know.   Erika had gone through trial sessions with several other artists until she found [The Glamourist].  That's when she knew... :D
      
      This wedding could not be complete without the beautiful imagery of [Alison Yin].
