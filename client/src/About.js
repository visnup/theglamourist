# I love empowering women through beauty.

A clumsy makeup artist, a new wife, daughter, sister and a mother to 2 furry
babies... I laugh a lot, find amusement in the random things, and Instagram
lot.

Iâ€™m a lover of simplicity, effortless style, clean design, and random
occurrences. You can often find me in false lashes, sipping on an iced coffee
or enjoying a refreshing glass of white wine. I enjoy a good weekend brunch,
great conversation, and even better company.

To know me is to love me so get to know me here.

Oh yea, puppies are my weakness.
